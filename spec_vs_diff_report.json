  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements (REQ-37 through REQ-40) with most acceptance criteria met. Key components are created: PromotionalAdsCarousel, PinVerificationModal, BalanceRevealCard, SpendingLimitsSummary, and ChallengesLeaderboardPreview. However, there is one notable gap: the REQ-40 acceptance criterion requiring a success toast when completing a challenge is not evidenced in the diff. Additionally, the ChallengesLeaderboardPreview shows challenge description rather than a title and lacks a dedicated progress indicator.",
