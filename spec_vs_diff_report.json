  "summary": "The diff implements all 8 requirements for bank account linking functionality. Backend adds bankAccountNumber field to UserProfile, implements setBankAccount and getBankAccount functions with proper access control. Frontend creates BankLinkingPage component with form validation and success/error handling, implements useSetBankAccount and useGetBankAccount hooks using React Query, adds /bank-linking route with authentication guard, and adds navigation link on ProfilePage with linked status indicator. A migration module handles schema changes. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
